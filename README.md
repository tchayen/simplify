Implementation of Visvalingamâ€™s algorithm for line simplification.

Runs in `O(n*log(n))` time.

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/tchayen/simplify
```

## Usage
> _ðŸš§ The lib is currently in progress, usage is not recommended yet ðŸš§_

## TODO
- decide what metrics should be available to user (i.e. target percentage of
points, target fixed number of points etc.)
- design API with different use cases in mind (both processing and outputting
filtered arrays)
- provide examples (maybe some interactive website?)

## API draft

```go
// Process points without filtering:
Process(points, simplify.NORMALIZE) // Put Z-coordinate in range [0,1]
Process(points, simplify.AREAS) // Use Z-coordinate for accurate area storage.

// Simply return array of points:
p, err := Simplify(points, T{percentage: 30})
p, err := Simplify(points, T{amount: 1520})
p, err := Simplify(points, T{area: 1.5})
```
